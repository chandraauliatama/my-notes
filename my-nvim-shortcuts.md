# Vim's Secret Language

This is a chapter for reflecting, consolidating your knowledge and appreciating how far you've come.

Write down all the operators, motions and commands that you've learned thus far. Don't take a look at the cheatsheet or any other reference. Just write down the ones that you can remember from the top of your head.

> Remember that you can use mnemonics to recall the commands based on what they do. Vim is really great at that.
